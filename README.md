# Duck-Shooter

A carnival themed arcade shooter made using SpriteKit programmatically from scratch.

Support for iPad (4:3 aspect ratio) (13.0+) and macOS (10.15+) using Mac Catalyst.

# Technologies and Frameworks Used :

- Extensive use of **Property Observers** to update UI.
- Handling **Timer** creation and invalidation.
- Creating custom **Animations** which pause in-between levels.
- Adding custom functionality on **User Touch**.
